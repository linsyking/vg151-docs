   Lab 7 <l7/lab7>

``VG151`` is a basic programming course that introduce basic concepts in programming. It includes teaching MATLAB, C and C++.

What is this project?
=====================

I am a TA for 2022-FA ENGR1510J. I will put my lab slides, useful tools and materials here for everyone to browse.

Why are some labs materials missing?
====================================

This is because:

* We have online courses for several weeks at the beginning of this semester
* I used Revealjs_ to prepare my lab slides for the first half of the semester. However, the effects were not satisfying.

Basically, I want the slides/docs to have the following properties:

* Easy to use (can copy the code directly)
* Easy to read
* Easy to search
* Easy for me to do the lecture
